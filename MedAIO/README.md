Problem Statement:
	There are several problems related to healthcare, which we want to solve creating a website. The problems are-
•	Patient lose their prescription
•	Most of the patients can’t read Doctor’s handwriting. So it becomes a problem to know the name of the medicine and the dosage by reading the prescription.
•	Patient often  hide their past medical history to doctors and  at blood donation camps
•	Many pharmacies sell generic medicines at higher cost.
•	Sometimes patients remain unaware of the expiry date of the medicine and foul pharmacist sell expired medicines for profits.
•	After being well, people often keep remaining medicines at their home and let them expire rather than donating them to nearby medicine banks.
Proposed Solution 
	To solve the above mentioned problems we are creating a website, that will-
•	Connect the patients, doctors and pharmacies.
•	Keep count of the medicines of the pharmacies and their prices (given by the pharmacist).
•	Keep medical history of patients and name of the doctor they visited and the prescriptions.
•	Make the patient aware of the batch number, expiry date and manufacturer.
•	Compare prices of the prescribed medicines at the nearby pharmacies.
•	Give option to take away from the selected pharmacy or home delivery(specially for senior citizens).
•	Send notification to the patient and the doctor if pharmacist gives any substitute medicine.
•	Update the batch number and expiry date if the patient buys same medicine next time.
•	Send notification asking the patient if he/she is totally fit if they stop buying new medicine and if they say yes, it will update in the website.
•	Send notification to patient if they have extra medicine lying around to donate that to nearby medicine bank.
•	Send prescriptions and medicine bills via messages, so that rural people who don’t have access to internet also get notified what medicines they are getting.

What is unique about proposed solution?
	The proposed solution is unique because-
•	It will make easier to doctors to study the medical history of the patient
•	It will help the patient to buy medicines at cheaper prices.
•	It will make aware the patient about the medicine, their dosage and expiry date.
•	If any patient dies due to wrong medication, it’ll be easier to investigation.
•	It will increase availability of medicine to poor people as it will remind patients to share their unused medicines to nearby medicine banks.
•	Pharmacists will think twice before selling any expired medicine or substitute medicine for their own profit.
Future possible enhancements
	We can make some future enhancements like:
•	Creating a mobile app
•	Creating a toll-free number for senior citizens (who don’t know much about internet and web-browsing) and rural people (who don’t have access to internet).
