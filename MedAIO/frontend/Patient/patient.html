                    Safe and Effective Treatment: Prescriptions ensure that patients receive appropriate and effective treatments tailored to their medical condition. Healthcare professionals use their expertise to prescribe medications that are suitable for a patient's diagnosis and health history.
                </li>
               <li>
                Accurate Dosage: Prescriptions specify the correct dosage of medication that patients should take. This helps prevent underdosing or overdosing, both of which can have negative consequences for a patient's health.
               </li>
               <li>
                Guidance for Patients: Prescriptions provide clear instructions on how to take medications, including when, how often, and with what precautions (e.g., with food, before bedtime). This guidance ensures that patients follow the treatment plan correctly.
               </li>
                <li>
                    Prevention of Errors: Written prescriptions help reduce the risk of medication errors. Clear and accurate instructions leave less room for misinterpretation, minimizing the chance of taking the wrong medication or incorrect dosage.
